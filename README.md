<h3 align="center">Super Charge Your <i><b>PURPLE TEAM</b></i> Exercises with Threat Intelligence ðŸ¥³</h3>
<p align="center">When it comes to Purple Teaming Exercises, threat intelligence can play a critical role in ensuring that the most relevant adversaries and threats are emulated based upon your organizationâ€™s threat landscape. This talk will walk through all the various aspects of purple teaming exercises where the incorporation of threat intelligence could be useful including the prioritization of threats to emulate, threat actor and internal attack data TTPs, detection or block suggestions for Blue Teams, indicators of emulation for Red Teams, and more. Weâ€™ll discuss strategies the various teams can use to collaborate along with metrics to help refine processes and provide value to the organization. Weâ€™ll be using the Purple Team Exercise Framework (PTEF) as a standard to map out how threat intel can super charge purple team exercises.</p>
